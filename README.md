#Sinema

Android application that uses the yts.re API to fetch the newest movies in DVD or BR quality. You have the option to download the torrent and remotely sync or send it to your computer using BitTorrent Remote or BitTorrent Sync.


#Usage

BitTorrent Remote
=================

The default download method is BitTorrent Remote.
This requires you to download BitTorrent Remote on your smartphone.
Next you must install BitTorrent Client on you computer.
Activate remote usage on the client and you are ready to go.
BUT when you download with BitTorrent Remote, your computer must be running BitTorrent Client.

BitTorrent Sync
=================

The second option, and in my opinion the best one, is BitTorrent Sync.
This requires you to download BitTorrent Sync on your smathphone.
Next you must install BitTorrent Client AND BitTorrent Sync on you computer.
Setup BitTorrent Sync as you want it.
In your preferences (Bittorrent Client) go to 
Directories -> Location of .torrents -> Automatically load .torrents from -> YOUR SYNC DIRECTORY
Also, check the delete loaded .torrents and enable search in subdirectoties.
Now open Sinema and go to settings, in General -> Transfer Method choose BitTorrent Sync.
Go back to the main page and you will be asked to choose your SYNC DIRECTORY. (Long hold the directory).
If you have accidently chosen the wrong path, you can always go to settings -> general -> BitTorrent Sync Path and just remove the text in there. Once you go back to the main page, it will ask you to choose the path again.
Now you are ready to go.

Enjoy!
